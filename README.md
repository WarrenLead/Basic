My Basic Programs

- Lotto.bas - my first program written on the IBM PC/XT in Basica circa 1987
- Menu210.bas - one of my first professional Quick basic programs I wrote in 1991
- TST11.BAS - a neat program to set the time on your computer by dialing up a time server in the days before the internet

There were others I wrote for my Bulletin Board... Koala Country BBS
